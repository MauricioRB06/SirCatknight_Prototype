      \r\namong the slides and found a friendly hamster to play with, while more
      hamsters were coming out of the arena. \r\nSuddenly 50 hamsters emerged out
      of nowhere Perseo didn't know what they wanted, but he felt intimidated. \r\nHe
      was too far away from Ziel to ask for help. So, throwing claws, he spun around
      to fill the furry body of the evil \r\ncreatures with sand. That gave him enough
      time to slip away to where Ziel was. \r\nThe surviving hamsters watched him
      from afar as if anticipating his revenge. Meanwhile Perseo enjoyed the \r\nsafety
      of Ziel's arms."

      the pretentious cats came to wake him up every time he fell asleep, they threw
      all kinds of things at him, whatever they \r\nhad in their claws, he could
      no longer close his eyes in front of the ruffianies committed. In the mall,

      post, the scratching post barely standing on the end of the shelf. \r\nZiel,

      memory.  After the fire appeared in the form of Miaushroom attacking Ziel,
      \r\nPerseo and the unrealism of his mind would lead him to seek how to protect
      her, so he set out on a path, which became \r\nless and less distinguishable,
      until he fell into a deep hole, the darkness and tranquility were abysmal,
      \r\nhe knew that he was now in the mines of Valmaril, the lair of Miaushroom.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile
      Ziel thought it would be no challenge for Perseus to climb over the edge and

      goodbye to \r\nZiel and ventured into the tunnel, thinking: \"It must lead
      me somewhere\".\r\n\r\nZiel had to look for a way to find Perseus, he supposed
      that he would have to enter a passage to an abandoned castle \r\nof which he
      had heard before leaving for the camp. So it was that Ziel entered the castle
      and in search of Perseo\r\n was trapped in a cage after activating an anti-invasion
      system in the most clumsy way.\r\n\r\nShe screamed with all her strength for
      Perseus to hear her, and Perseus, already inside the castle, \r\ncould not
      find where the voice was coming from. When suddenly he entered the lobby and
      saw \r\nZiel inside a hanging cage and on it lay a marauding cat that Perseus
      immediately recognized, it was Miauvil!.\r\n\r\nNow Perseo, swift and determined,
      confronted Miauvil. With three meows and a couple of claws he chased him \r\naway,

      from his confinement."
